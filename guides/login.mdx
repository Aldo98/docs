# **Guide**

Welcome to Harkha — a platform designed to help businesses activate and manage WhatsApp for professional use. Harkha provides access to advanced WhatsApp Business tools and APIs, making setup simple and self-managed. While the official WhatsApp Self-Serve system offers free setup with no monthly commitments, Harkha delivers the same core functionality along with affordable service packages and a built-in AI assistant to guide you through each step.

Before getting started, please make sure to review the WhatsApp Commerce Policy to confirm your business meets the requirements for using WhatsApp Business services. Through Harkha, you can easily manage your WhatsApp Business Account and connected phone numbers through a clean and user-friendly dashboard.
