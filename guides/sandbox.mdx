# Sandbox

The Sandbox environment provides a safe testing space where you can experiment with and verify your WhatsApp Business API setup before deploying it to production. It allows you to explore messaging behavior, adjust configurations, and validate system functionality—all without impacting real customers or live data.

Within the sandbox, you are able to:

- Try out API features, with any applicable usage fees deducted from your Wallet balance.
- Send messages using the assigned sandbox number: **\+62 889-0555-9928**.
- Define any test recipient by entering the appropriate country code and WhatsApp number.
- Compose and send custom text messages or include sample media files.
- Use built-in templates and predefined interactions to test interactive message flows.
