## Opt-in

Opt-in mechanisms allow businesses to obtain user consent before initiating communication on WhatsApp. Your WARe platform provides multiple secure and flexible methods to capture, register, and manage user opt-ins—whether acquired externally through API, via QR code and short links, or automatically during a user’s first interaction. These mechanisms ensure compliance with WhatsApp policies while enabling businesses to build a verified and engaged audience.

### **Business-Managed Opt-In (API Method)**

This method enables businesses to collect user consent outside the WARe platform and register those opted-in users directly through the API. It is designed for organizations that manage their own consent flows and want full control over how and where opt-in is captured.

### **Encrypted Short Link & QR Code**

The system generates a secure short link and QR code—provided by WhatsApp—with a predefined message attached. When users scan the code or open the link, the prefilled message is automatically populated in their WhatsApp chat, making it easier for them to opt in with a single tap.

**Components:**

- **Prefilled Message** – The message users send to confirm opt-in
- **Generate Button** – Creates a new encrypted link and QR code

### **Automated Opt-In Message (Recommended)**

Traditionally, users become active by sending a message to your WhatsApp number. WARe enhances this process by allowing an automated opt-in message to be sent during the first interaction. This gives users a clear choice to opt in immediately, helping you grow your active user base more efficiently.

### **System Language Preference**

You can configure the system language within the app. This language determines how opt-ins are requested and displayed to users(e.g English). The preference can be changed anytime.

### **Smart Ways to Acquire Active & Opted-In Users**

The platform supports multiple smart methods for engaging users and obtaining opt-in consent, including:

- **QR Codes**
- **Link URLs**

These tools help users quickly begin a conversation or give permission for future communications.

\*\*\*\*Notes \*\*To send template messages or allow users to initiate conversations through session messaging, you can use any of the opt-in methods listed above. WARe automatically tracks all onboarded, active, and opted-in users. You can view the full list anytime in the **Users** section of your dashboard.
